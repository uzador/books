# mutual exclusion

## mutual exclusion

### critical section

#### block of code that can be executed by only one thread at a time

### At most one thread holds the lock at any time

## Freedom from deadlock

### If a thread is attempting to acquire or release the lock then eventually some thread acquires or releases the lock

### If a thread calls lock\(\) and never returns, then other threads must complete an infinite number of critical sections

## Freedom from starvation

### Every thread that attempts to acquire or release the lock eventually succeeds

## livelock

### in which two or more threads actively prevent each other from making progress by taking steps that subvert steps taken by other threads

## bounded wait\-free

### A section of code that is guaranteed to complete in a bounded number of steps
